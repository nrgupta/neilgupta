Welcome to My Personal Website Repository
Hi there! I'm Neil Gupta ... 

This repository contains the code and structure for my personal website: neilg2001.github.io/neilgupta. 

This site serves as my online portfolio and resume, where I share my background, experiences, and interests.

About the Website
The website offers a glimpse into my life, career, and hobbies. It includes sections about my education, my work as a Software Engineer at PayPal, and some of the key roles and projects I’ve worked on in the past.

I also share a bit about my personal interests, like sports, cooking, and music, as well as my involvement with organizations like Kappa Theta Pi, a professional technology fraternity at the University of Michigan.
